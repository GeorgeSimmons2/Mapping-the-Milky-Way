abstract="William Herschel's epochal observing campaign, using a self-made 18.7-in. reflector, lasted from 1783 to 1802. During his `sweeps,' designed to find new nebulae and star clusters, he carried out a great number of star counts. In these so-called `star gages' Herschel counted the number of stars seen in the field of view. One major result was the star distribution for a considerable part of the sky, observable from the Windsor area. Of course, the stars appeared strongly concentrated towards the band of the Milky Way.",

abstract="During the Second World War, a number of radar scientists independently discovered powerful radio emission from the Sun. Following the cessation of hostilities, and making use of their wartime experience, scientists, mostly at Jodrell Bank and Cambridge in the UK and in Sydney, Australia, used discarded radar systems to further investigate the complex solar radio emission, discovered powerful radio emission from old supernova explosions, and even more powerful radio sources from what later became known as radio galaxies. Encouraged by their early successes with relatively primitive equipment and the potential for new discoveries, scientists in the UK, Australia, the USSR, and the Netherlands developed plans to build more powerful radio telescopes and sophisticated new instrumentation.",

The velocity components of HI clouds were determined using Gaussian decomposition of the observed spectrum and these values were projected onto the Galactic plane for the identification of spiral structure of the galaxy. The Perseus, Local and Outer arms were identified using the Longitude velocity plots and x-y plots (face-on maps). The rotational velocities of the HI clouds were determined using the tangent-point method and the resulting rotation curve comes out to be consistent with the literature in the range 4 â‰¤ R â‰¤ 8 kpc.}

ABSTRACT = {We review the current status of the study of rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way, and present a unified RC from the Galactic Center to the galacto-centric distance of about 100 kpc. The RC is used to directly calculate the distribution of the surface mass density (SMD). We then propose a method to derive the distribution of dark matter (DM) density in the in the Milky Way using the SMD distribution. The best-fit dark halo profile yielded a local DM density of &rho; âŠ™ = 0.36 &plusmn; 0.02 GeV cm &minus; 3 . We also review the estimations of the local DM density in the last decade, and show that the value is converging to a value at &rho; âŠ™ = 0.39 &plusmn; 0.09 GeV cm &minus; 3 .},

journal = {Research Notes of the AAS},
abstract = {The tangent point method (TPM) is commonly used to calculate the rotation curve of the inner portion of the Milky Way, relying on the assumption that along one line of sight, the point tangent to the Galactic center is the point where the observed radial velocity is an extremum. This work compares rotation curves derived from the TPM, using neutral hydrogen gas data, and direct measurements of stellar positions and velocities from the Gaia Satellite. The Gaia data indicate that the rotation curve based upon stellar kinematics is much shallower than that previously reported based on the TPM, especially in the inner regions of the Galaxy. Additionally, based on stellar kinematics, the locations of the extremum radial velocities and tangent points often differ. While these results are consistent with previously published simulations, future data from the Gaia satellite will allow for further confidence in determining an accurate rotation curve.}

abstract={Now in its sixth edition this successful undergraduate textbook gives a well-balanced and comprehensive introduction to the topics of classical and modern astronomy. While emphasizing both the astronomical concepts and the underlying physical principles, the text provides a sound basis for more profound studies in the astronomical sciences. The chapters on galactic and extragalactic astronomy as well as cosmology were extensively modernized in the previous edition. In this new edition they have been further revised to include more recent results. The long chapter on the solar system has been split into two parts: the first one deals with the general properties, and the other one describes individual objects. A new chapter on exoplanets has been added to the end of the book next to the chapter on astrobiology. In response to the fact that astronomy has evolved enormously over the last few years, only a few chapters of this book have been left unmodified. Long considered a standard text for physical science majors, Fundamental Astronomy is also an excellent reference and entrÃ©e for dedicated amateur astronomers. For their benefit the introductory chapter has been extended to give a brief summary of the different types of celestial objects. From reviews of earlier editions: " . The wide range of expertise gives the book an authority that would be almost impossible for a single-author text . There are other aids to the reader: worked examples . starred sections in small print take the inquisitive reader beyond the general level of the book." (Nature) "This textbook, suitable for a university first course in astronomy, is the outgrowth of a long and outstanding astronomical tradition in Finland, and the result of an extensive collaborative effort, which included also teaching and interaction with many people. . I highly recommend this book for class use . it will be useful for professionals as well." (Bruno Bertotti, Prometeo, Vol. 24 (3-4), 2008)},
